# Monotype Variable Font Demo - Avenir Next™
 
Monotype is pleased to introduce a variable font demo based on the Avenir Next family. Avenir Next was designed by Adrian Frutiger with expanded rework by Monotype Type Director Akira Kobayashi.
 
Avenir Next is a humanist design san serif with clean, classic styling.
 
This Variable Font demo was made to showcase the capabilities in the new OpenType version 1.8 specification. Please read the [EULA], which limits usage for development, prototyping and testing purposes – and not for re-distribution or commercial use.

**_Note:_** The latest version fixes a problem with HVAR table and also adds variations to the GPOS kerning feature.

To test the functionality in this font, try [FontView].
